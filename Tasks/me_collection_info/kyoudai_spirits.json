    "richDescription": "üåé World Of Kyoudai (WoK) \n\nWorld Of Kyoudai is a MMORPG with a fun twist - Take control of your character, solve quests, meet other players, fight the enemies and explore the world. If you don‚Äôt feel like slaying enemies, you can try many activities - chop down the trees, mine the stones or collect several distinct assets and resources that you can then use to craft items or just sell them on the market for a profit. If you‚Äôre feeling playful, find one of many arcade machines in the game and click on it to jump straight into a quick arcade game - just for fun, but also as a part of a tournament with other players inside the World Of Kyoudai to compete for interesting prizes. \n\nüëª About This Mint \n\nMint one of the ‚ÄúSpirits‚Äù of 14 mythical races. Each spirit lives in one of 14 different regions of the World Of Kyoudai. The spirit is your ticket to get inside the game world, but you will never know what your spirit is and what it‚Äôs capable of before the reveal process.The revealed NFT represents your character - your skill tree, skill points and unique items you equip along the way. Your save state is tied to the NFT character you are playing with and metadata will change dynamically as you progress. Thanks to that, you can also transfer, sell or buy the game state second-hand here on an NFT marketplace‚Äîsuch as MagicEden‚Äîby listing your character.\n\nüïπÔ∏è Can I play it ? \n\nYou will use your NFT to join the game‚Äôs early access anytime during the development starting this month. If you want to shape up the game and adjust the development direction, set up in-game events, and receive royalties from the game world: join the Guardians Of Kyoudai by buying one of 888 limited OG Kyoudais here on MagicEden that we minted back in December 2021.\n\n[Youtube Gameplays](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMu8CH9eIEVje7_cL_jjrtg)\n\n![Kyoudai_Preview](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/966029619260174346/970339126782095411/batch_1.gif)\n![Kyoudai_Preview](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/966029619260174346/970339127180558347/batch_2.gif)\n\n# The Lore of the Spirits: \n*Kyoudai was a utopia until an elder Guardian, Haddam√∏n, broke his vows of protection and performed the forbidden Nergal incantation.\nOnce he recited the cursed words, the ancient protection against the underworld‚Äîone a legendary Kyoudai had put in place centuries ago‚Äîdisintegrated.\nWithout time to waste, the Guardians of Kyoudai consulted the All-Seeing One and, with his blessing, they summoned 4444 Kyoudai Spirits to defeat the evil force‚Äîand restore peace in the World of Kyoudai.*\n",
